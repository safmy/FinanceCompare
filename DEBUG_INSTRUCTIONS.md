# PDF Upload Debugging Instructions

## The Issue
Your PDF uploads are not working - showing 0 transactions and 0 spending. This is likely due to:
1. Corrupted PDFs (especially CurrentAccount PDFs showing "Unexpected end of stream" errors)
2. Missing OpenAI API key for categorization
3. PDF format not being recognized by the parsers

## How to Debug

### 1. Check Your Browser Console
When you upload a PDF in the web interface, open your browser's Developer Console (F12) and look for the debug logs:
- `=== PDF Upload Debug Start ===`
- Details about files being uploaded
- API response information
- Any error messages

### 2. Run the Backend API Locally
```bash
cd FinanceCompare/api
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"  # Optional but recommended
python3 app.py
```

Watch the terminal output when you upload PDFs. You'll see:
- PDF processing details
- Text extraction attempts
- Transaction parsing results

### 3. Test Individual PDFs
Use the test script to check specific PDFs:

```bash
cd FinanceCompare
python3 test_pdf_upload_debug.py "current account/CreditCard/2025-01-09_Statement.pdf"
```

This will show:
- Whether the PDF can be read
- How much text is extracted
- What transactions are found

### 4. Check PDF Files
Run the PDF checker to see which files are readable:

```bash
cd FinanceCompare
python3 check_pdf_files.py
```

## Current Findings

1. **CurrentAccount PDFs**: All showing "Unexpected end of stream" errors - these PDFs appear to be corrupted or in a format PyPDF2 can't read properly.

2. **CreditCard PDFs**: These are readable and contain text.

3. **Zivile PDFs**: Also showing errors similar to CurrentAccount.

## Solutions to Try

### 1. Re-export PDFs
If possible, re-download or re-export the CurrentAccount PDFs from your bank. They seem to be corrupted.

### 2. Use Working PDFs
Start with the CreditCard PDFs which are readable:
- Upload files from `current account/CreditCard/` directory
- These should process correctly

### 3. Set OpenAI API Key
For automatic categorization, set your OpenAI API key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

### 4. Check API Deployment
If using the deployed API on Render:
1. Check the Render dashboard for logs
2. Ensure environment variables are set (especially OPENAI_API_KEY)
3. Check if the service is running

### 5. Manual Testing
Try uploading a single CreditCard PDF first:
1. Go to the web interface
2. Click "Choose PDF Files"
3. Select `current account/CreditCard/2025-01-09_Statement.pdf`
4. Click "Process All PDFs"
5. Check browser console for debug output

## What the Debug Logs Show

The enhanced logging will show:
- File upload details (name, size, month)
- API communication (URL, status, headers)
- Response parsing (transaction count, summary)
- Any errors during processing

## If Still Not Working

1. **Check Network**: Ensure the API URL is correct and accessible
2. **Check CORS**: The API has CORS enabled, but check browser network tab for CORS errors
3. **Try Local API**: Run the API locally instead of using the deployed version
4. **Inspect Response**: Look at the full API response in browser Network tab

## Alternative: Use JavaScript Files

If PDFs continue to fail, you can use the existing JavaScript files:
1. Upload `current account/creditcardss.js` or `current account/zivile.js`
2. These contain pre-extracted transaction data
3. Should work without any PDF parsing

## Need More Help?

Check the API logs on your deployment platform (Render) for server-side errors. The enhanced logging should pinpoint exactly where the process is failing.
